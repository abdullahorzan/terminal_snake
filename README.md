## Terminal Snake

This is the terminal remake of an old and well-known snake game with some upgrades. 
I worked on this game as my Python 3 course terminal-based final project. It helped me learn different aspects of programming with terminal, and it challenged me to think differently. Above all, I  had a great time with the progress!

## Instructions

As you are most likely to know, eat the foods on the screen and grow your snake until no place to move on.

| Keys            | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Up Key | Move Up |
| Down  Key| Move Down |
| Left  Key | Move Left |
| Right  Key| Move Right |


## Play

To play the game,  clone the repo and run the file: 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/abdullahorzan/terminal_snake
  cd terminal_snake && python3 terminal_snake.py
```
Then, you can easily choose any menu option to start the game. 

Annotation: You can easily skip the black screen, which is occurred when you select the skin option by the press enter key.
    
## Possible Improvements

- Different foods with different scores.
- Fixing the skin option to a more good-looking and effective one.
- Your creative idea.
